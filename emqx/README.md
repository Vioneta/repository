[![Release][release-shield]][release] ![Project Stage][project-stage-shield] ![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]

The most scalable open-source MQTT broker for IoT, IIoT, and connected vehicles.

## About

[EMQX][emqx] is an Open-source MQTT broker with a high-performance real-time
message processing engine, powering event streaming for IoT devices at massive
scale. As the most scalable MQTT broker, EMQX can help you connect any device,
at any scale (including your home).

The [EMQX MQTT broker][emqx] is an advanced alternative to the Mosquitto MQTT
broker/add-on that is generally used in Vioneta Agro. It has a UI
to configure, manage, and debug your MQTT broker, clients, and traffic.

While EMQX sells their product mainly as a cloud hosted product on their
website, this add-on runs EMQX in a fully local, self-hosted environment.
