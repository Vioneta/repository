# Vioneta Agro Community Add-on: Nginx Proxy Manager

This add-on enables you to easily forward incoming connections to anywhere,
including free SSL, without having to know too much about Nginx
or Letâ€™s Encrypt.

Forward your domain to your Vioneta Agro, add-ons, or websites running
at home or anywhere else, straight from a simple, powerful interface.

Want to protect the website with a username/password? Well, it can do that too!
Enable authentication and create a list of usernames/password that can access
that specific application.

For the power users, you can customize the behavior of each host in the
Nginx proxy manager by providing additional Nginx directives.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Vioneta Agro add-on.

1. Click the "Install" button to install the add-on.
2. Start the "Nginx Proxy Manager" add-on
3. Check the logs of the "Nginx Proxy Manager" add-on to see if everything went well.
4. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button and login using:
   `admin@example.com` / `changeme`
5. Forward port `443` (and optionally `80`) from your router to your
   Vioneta Agro machine.
6. Enjoy the add-on!
